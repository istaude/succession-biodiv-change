## About 
This repository contains all the R code and data to reproduce the 
figures in *"Biodiversity change in light of succession theory"*.

## Folder structure

1. The .R files contain the R code to reproduce the underlying simulated data for each figure, the figures themselves, and, if applicable, any analysis (for Figure 2c).

2. `Data` contains the previously published data by [Vellend et al 2013](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1312779110.).
